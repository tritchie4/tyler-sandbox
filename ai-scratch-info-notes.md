- AI - perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information via machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by living beings
- Machine Learning - an application of AI that provides systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being programmed by an external source
- Deep Learning - solving problems by emulating the working of human brain
	- Uses Neural Networks, which use multiple mathematical operations to break down a complex problem into smaller parts (solved individually); each math expression is a "Neuron"

## Cross-cutting Concerns
(sourced from ["LLM Applications for Production"](https://huyenchip.com/2023/04/11/llm-engineering.html))

1. Ambiguity of natural languages
	- How users define instructions, and how LLMs respond to these instructions
	- If someone enters in a language prompt wrong it will still run but give different output (no error)
2. Inconsistency in user experience
	- Thereâ€™s no guarantee that an LLM will give you the same output for the same input every time
